## Usage

### 0. Installation
* Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/YtongXie/MB-DCNN.git
cd MB-DCNN
```
### 1. Data Preparation
* Download [ISIC2017 dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data), [Extra 1320 images](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery?filter=%5B%5D)(The ID information of the extra 1320 images is listed in `./dataset/Extra_images.csv`) <br/>

* Put the data under `./dataset/data/` 

* Run `python ./dataset/extractPatch_cls_train.py` and `python ./dataset/extractPatch_cls_val_test.py` to obtain the cropped training, validation and testing patches for classification task.

* Run `python ./dataset/extractPatch_seg_train.py` to obtain the resized training patches for segmentation task.

* Run `python ./dataset/list_cls.py` and `python ./dataset/list_seg.py` to generate the data lists.

### 2. Training coarse segmentation network (coarse-SN)
* Download pretrained weights from [Deeplabv3+](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11lgslZ4ayeYZTUQ99Ccu5hpgAWzfLPqj/view), [Xception](http://data.lip6.fr/cadene/pretrainedmodels/xception-43020ad28.pth) and put them under `./models/`  .

* Run `python train_CoarseSN.py` to train the coarse segmentation network for roughly segmenting skin lesions.

* The segmentation network structure is defined in `./net/models.py`, and the hybrid loss is defined in `./net/loss.py`.

### 3. Generating coarse masks
* Run `python generate_Coarse_mask.py` to obtain the coarse masks for mask-CN and enhanced-SN.

### 4. Training mask-guided classification network (mask-CN)
* Run `python train_MaskCN.py` to train the mask-guided classification network for skin lesion classification.

* The classification network structure is defined in `./net/models.py`, and the loss is cross-entropy loss.

### 5. Training enhanced segmentation network (enhanced-SN)
* Run `python train_EnhancedSN.py` to train the enhanced segmentation network for more accurate skin lesion segmentation.

### 6. Evaluation
* Run `python eval_MaskCN.py` and `python eval_EnhancedSN.py` to start the evaluation.
